### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github!

I'm a computer engineering student at the University of Toronto. I like all things tech, but I love compilers, and I love operating systems. Despite my unhealthy love for rust, I am currently looking for any and all excuses to write C, unnecessarily drop into inline assembly, and abuse intrinsics.
